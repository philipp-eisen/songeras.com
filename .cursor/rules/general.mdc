## Icon Naming Convention

When importing icons from `@phosphor-icons/react`, always use the "Icon" suffix in the import name. For example:

- ✅ `SpotifyLogoIcon` (correct)
- ❌ `SpotifyLogo` (deprecated - do not use)

All icon imports from `@phosphor-icons/react` must end with "Icon" to maintain consistency across the codebase.
